You can choose the block type you want with the select box, then let's put your images and write your text:

![Block type](/doc/img/block-type.png "Block type")

Additionnally, you may have some mandatory fields to fill to have a nice case study to display, let yourself be guided with the instructions diplayed under each field.

For a better rendering, you have to set a featured image on each case study. 
You can also choose to highlight you case study, in this case it will be displayed on the home page.
